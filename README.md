# tt.alpha
[TTtie Bot](https://github.com/TTtie/TTtie-Bot), but with better code.<br>
It is actually made in [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris).

#Database
Actually the database does nothing, however, in later future, it might do something.<br>
The database is RethinkDB, and is a dependency for [`db.js`](./db.js) file

#How to set up
1. Rename `exampleconfig.json` to `config.json`
2. Edit token, oid, prefix and optional, but if you need, dbotskey properties.
3. Run `run.js`

#Creating events/commands
Refer to [EVENTS.md](./EVENTS.md) or [COMMANDS.md](./COMMANDS.md).

#Development
As the name says, the bot is still in development. You can help recreating all [TTtie Bot](https://github.com/TTtie/TTtie-Bot) commands by submitting a pull request.
